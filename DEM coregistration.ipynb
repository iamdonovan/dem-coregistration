    "When comparing two different elevation models, it is important to ensure that the elevation models are not shifted relative to each other. Small horizontal and vertical shifts between the two elevation models introduce biases that lead to inaccurate estimation of the differences between the two elevation models. Fortunately, by comparing the elevation differences with the slope and aspect of the points where the differences are measured, we can model and remove these shifts, leading to more accurate estimations of the differences between two elevation models. Further details can be found in [Nuth and Kääb (2011)](https://www.the-cryosphere.net/5/271/2011/tc-5-271-2011.html).\n",
